 what to expect over the next few lessons.

The first shell script
- creates new user accounts 
- make sure the person who executes the script has the proper privileges to do so
- make sure the specified account was created successfully if for some reason the account
  creation process fails.

After 
- expand it and make it better by automatically
	-- generating random passwords accepting command line arguments and so on.

you know what you're trying to accomplish learn all the concepts and techniques
to build that script and complete your first project.

Having a goal in mind and a project to implement will actually help you learn and retain the material

understand how why and most importantly when to use everything you're taught.

You'll start out using these new skills to accomplish meaningful work in a relatively short period of time.

With that said over the next four lessons I'm going to be performing some demonstrations and doing a good bit of teaching but just know that everything you're introduced to is needed in order to write and use that for script.

If you are itching to dive in right away you can follow along with me during those lessons.

Keep in mind if you do that you're probably going to be making good use of the pause button to give yourself enough time to type up the scripts try out the commands and so on.
By the way all the scripts you'll see and the lessons are included in the course download so you can
quickly refer back to them without having to read watch the entire lessons.
If you choose to simply watch and absorb all the information coming at you during the next four lessons
that's perfectly fine too because you'll get to practice those skills while working on the first scripting exercise after those first four initial lessons you're going to get some very clear instructions on what the shellscript should do and how it should work.
Then you'll go off in a write and test that shellscript on your own.
Of course you can refer to any of their previous lessons and demonstration scripts to help you complete that script after you write your script you'll get a chance to see me work through the exact same exercise you'll look over my shoulder as I write the shell script.
So that's what's in store for you.
All right.
Enough background information.
Let's get to scripting.
