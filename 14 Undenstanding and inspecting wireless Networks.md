#### WI-FI NETWORKS
Find, examine, and connect to Wi­Fi access points. 
Before some basic Wi­Fi terms and technologies.
 - **AP** (access point) This is the device wireless users connect to for internet access. 
 - **ESSID** (extended service set identifier) This is the same as the SSID, which we discussed in Chapter 3, but it can be used for multiple APs in a wireless LAN. 
 - **BSSID** (basic service set identifier) This is the unique identifier of each AP, and it is the same as the MAC address of the device. 
 - **SSID** (service set identifier) This is the name of the network. 
 - **Channels** Wi­Fi can operate on any one of 14 channels (1–14). In the United States, Wi­Fi is limited to channels 1–11. 
 - **Power** The closer you are to the Wi­Fi AP, the greater the power, and the easier the connection is to crack. 
 - **Security** protocol used on the Wi­Fi AP that is being read from. 
    -- .There are three primary security protocols for Wi­Fi. 
     - The original, Wired Equivalent Privacy (**WEP**) badly flawed and easily cracked. 
      - Wi­Fi Protected Access (**WPA**), was a bit more secure. 
      -  **WPA2­PSK**, which is much more secure and uses a preshared key (PSK) that all users share, is now used by nearly all Wi­Fi APs (except enterprise Wi­Fi). 

- **Modes** Wi­Fi can operate in one of three modes: **managed, master, or monitor**. You’ll learn what these modes mean in the following section. 
- **Wireless range** In the United States, a Wi­Fi AP must legally broadcast its signal at an upper limit of 0.5 watts. At this power, it has a normal range of about 300 feet (100 meters). High­gain antennas can extend this range to as much as 20 miles. 
- **Frequency** Wi­Fi is designed to operate on 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Modern Wi­Fi APs and wireless network cards often use both.
